# You can use this script to make a series of weekly awt upload datasets 
# for the rest of the current year. The lifetimes of the datasets get longer
# and longer, chosen so that each one expires a week after the week its
# name refers to.
#
# This script should ideally be run as Big Ben in London signals the start
# of each new year in UTC :-)
