## Information Collector 

The Information Collector agent runs periodically to obtain a list of 
eligible sites from the 
[OSG Pilot Factory GitHub repo](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-gfactory) 
and the details of storages and users from Rucio. This information is 
stored in the [Workflow Database](database.md).
