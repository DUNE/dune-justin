## Event types

These event types are used by justIn to record state transitions
and can be viewed in the [Dashboard](dashboard.md). They are especially useful
for cross
referencing requests, files, jobs, sites and storages, as the identity of
each component involved in the transition is recorded in the event and visible 
in the Dashboard.
