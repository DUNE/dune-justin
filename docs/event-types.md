## Event types

These event types are used by the Workflow System to record state transitions
and can be viewed in the Dashboard. These are especially useful for cross
referencing requests, files, jobs, sites and storages, as the identity of
each component involve in the transition is recorded in the event and visible 
in the Dashboard.
