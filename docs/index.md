## Workflow System documentation

Versioned copies of this documentation are kept in the docs subdirectory
of the [dune-wfs GitHub repo](https://github.com/DUNE/dune-wfs/). All the
files are in Markdown and so they can be read directly from the repository
if necessary. For convenience, the versions from the current release branch
are available as GitHub pages at https://dune.github.io/dune-wfs/
