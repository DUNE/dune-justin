# Event types

These event types are used within justIN to record state transitions
and can be viewed in the [Dashboard](dashboard.md). They are especially useful
for cross
referencing workflows, files, jobs, sites and storages, as the identity of
each component involved in the transition is recorded in the event and visible 
in the Dashboard.
